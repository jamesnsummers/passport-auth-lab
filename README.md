# Integrating Social Logins Lab

## Introduction

We've covered the concept of OAuth and how to implement it using Express. Let's take an app we've worked on previously and implement social login by adding `passport-facebook` functionality.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create a Facebook application on the Facebook developers portal
- Take the starter code and implement Facebook login
- Users should only be able to add candies when they are logged-in
- The form should only be visible when you're logged-in
- Make sure it is not possible to CRUD candies via cURL

**Bonus:**

- Add a reference to a user when a candy document is created and show the user details in the candy list
- Make sure only the user who created a candy can delete it

#### Deliverable

Please find screenshots of the [solution-code](solution-code) provided
